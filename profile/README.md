## Hi there 👋

Welcome!

Collaboration, community and curiosity - all essential to a vibrant open source ethos and part of Cloud Carib's culture. You’ll find us throughout the open source community, contributing to projects where we can. But we’re also hard at work solving technical challenges with innovative approaches and hope to be soon releasing those ideas as new open source projects.

We’re proud of the creativity and contributions of Cloud Carib's employees - from small but mighty open source projects to large community projects. Helping directly and indirectly.




<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
